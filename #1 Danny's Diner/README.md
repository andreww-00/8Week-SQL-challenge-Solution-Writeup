# Introduction:

- (Summaries of introduction and Problem from **[Case Study # 1](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)**

Danny opened a resuranut that sells sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny has collected some basic data over the past two months and needs my help to create data driven insights!

# Problem Statement:

Danny wants to answer questions like 'what are his customers visiting patterns?' or 'How much money they've spent at the resturaunt?' to help him deliver a better experience to his customers

His main goal is to use these insights to determine if he should expand his current customer loyalty program.

Danny has given me some sample data about his customers to work with

# Data:

The data I have been given is in 3 tables and encapsulates simple aspects of the customers. These datasets are as follows, as well as an Entity Relationship Diagram generated in MySQL.

- Sales: Shows which customer bought what on which day.
- Menu: Maps the product ID to their menu name and price.
- Members: Shows which customer has joined the rewards program on which day.

# Questions:
- What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
- What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
- What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
- Which item was the most popular for each customer?
- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
- Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
- What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
- In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
