# 8 Week SQL Challenge:
I am using this repository to document my solutions to **[Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)**. 
This will serve as a SQL checkpoint to see what more I need to learn. 

The Challenge is broken down into 8 distinct case studies each with unique questions, with a goal of creating valuable data driven insights for the company/person in the studies.
